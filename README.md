# Campus-WalkerCam
AMD-XilinxAdaptive Computing Challenge
# Overview
"Campus-WalkerCam" is a real-time Multi-object detection system dedicated to campus roads. This project implements Multi-object detection system based on Yolov3 on the KV260 development board. The "Campus-WalkerCam" project uses a self-made dataset for training and The test data set uses the campus road environment as the detection environment, and uses Yolov3 as the customized multi-target detection algorithm to realize the real-time detection system of pedestrian targets on the campus road.
